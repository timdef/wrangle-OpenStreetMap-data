    "In the first section of this project I clean the data and create csv's to be imported into an SQLite database using python. The data is parsed iteratively to deal with the large filesize.\n",

    "* __Zip Codes__\n",

    " * Eliminated anything that wasn't a zipcode\n",
    " * Eliminated zips not in California\n",
    " * Some began with 'CA'\n",

    "\n",
    "After becoming so familiar with this data I have begun to wonder if there isn't a way to make sure the data is normalized going into the OSM system. Perhaps there are technical barriers to this, but ensuring that certain values are entered uniformly (5 digit zips being a simple example) would make large scale analyses much easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "One potential issue with this idea is making a service that is largely kept update by volunteers harder to use, therefore makeing contributors less likely to loan their time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with a large (for me) dataset where much of the information was typed by humans was illuminating - I now know why there are so many articles that mention how much of a data professional's time is spent *cleaning* data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was great to parse xml iteratively in python (instead of reading the whole document into memory), and exploring with SQL was an excellent experience - very different from what I've done with pandas in the past. I've now done many, many SQL tutorials and it's left me wanting  more - the chance to answer real business questions perhaps, or to explore how to go back and forth between SQL and visualization tools. I feel that my firm grip on relational databases will be important as the data I deal with grows more and more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, in the meantime, I've found a couple hundred fixes I can contribute to the OSM project!"
